            "info": "The 6-point grading scale is a widely used system in educational institutions that provides a balanced assessment across six distinct performance levels. The scale ranges from 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest), with grades typically rounded to integers or half-integers.\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\n- **Grade Rounding**: Individual grades are usually rounded to integers or half-integers (e.g., 5.5)\n- **Overall Calculation**: A weighted mean is used to calculate the overall result, where the weight is proportional to the number of hours the subject was taught or its credit value\n- **Passing Requirement**: An overall result of at least 4.0 is typically required to pass\n- **Additional Conditions**: Sometimes a maximum number of grades below 4 is enforced\n- **Flexibility**: At advanced educational levels, individual subjects or courses can often be repeated if an insufficient grade is received, rather than repeating the entire period\n\n## Typical Performance\n\n- The average exam result is typically somewhat above 4, with a variance between 0.5 and 1\n- Performance varies depending on exam type, tested class, educational level, and other factors\n- Quarter steps (0.25 increments) are commonly used in exams to indicate grades between integers (e.g., 5.25)\n- Some assessments use finer-grained systems with steps of one-tenth (0.1), especially when grades are calculated as a linear function of achieved points\n\n## Grade Mappings\n\n| Grade | Percent | Description |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| 1 | 0% | Very poor |\n| 2 | 25% | Poor |\n| 3 | 45% | Insufficient |\n| 4 | 60% | Sufficient |\n| 4.5 | 70% | Satisfying |\n| 5 | 80% | Good |\n| 5.5 | 90% | Good to very good |\n| 6 | 100% | Very good |",
