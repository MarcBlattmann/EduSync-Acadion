# Welcome to EduSync Acadion 👋

EduSync Acadion collects grading systems from around the world. Use the [Systems Explorer](/systems) to find grading systems by country, and integrate them easily into your apps with our tools.

### Single-System App
If you're building an app for communities that only need one grading system, you can visit our [Systems Explorer](/systems) to get the system ID. Then, use the [GetSystem()]() function to load that grading system in your app.

### Multi-System App
If your users need different grading systems, you can retrieve all available systems using [GetAllSystems()](/docs/Tools/GetAllSystems()). Let users choose their preferred system, save it to your database, and use our tools with their specific grading system. This way, your app can adapt to each user's needs.
